# Bobby_name_generator 

Bobby Name Generator creates a Bobby name from your first and last name.

Rules: 
1. The first half of you "Bobby Name" is the first two letters of your last name. If the second letter of your last name is not a vowel, then the next letter from your last name is added on until you find the first vowel.
2. The second half of your "Bobby Name" is made up of simply the first two letters of your first name.
Ex: "Chris Chaney" turns into "Bobby Chach"
