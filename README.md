# Bobby_name_generator 

Bobby Name Generator creates a Bobby name from your first and last name.

Rules:
* The first half of you "Bobby Name" is the first two letters of your last name. If the second letter of your last name is not a vowel, then the next letter from your last name is added on until you find the first vowel.
* The second half of your "Bobby Name" is made up of simply the first two letters of your first name.
Ex: "Chris Chaney" turns into "Bobby Chach"
